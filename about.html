  <p class="text1 big">About Us</p>
  <p class="text1 small">The Visual Learner project is started by three DAA students: Marcela, Nanako, and Muchen.
    This project aims to cover different areas of knowledge such as literature, science, and mathematics through comics.
    This website supports middle school students who are finding difficulties in learning specific units from textbooks.</p>

    <p class="text2 small"><b class="medium">Marcela</b> is a weird girl. Her favorite thing to do in the world is learning
      new things such as plating the guitar, practicing gymnastics, and drawing. She hates the fact that she is the only person
      in the family whoâ€™s born in an odd year. She likes to sing, which makes her sister really mad at her. </p>

  <div class="box2">
    <p class="text2 small"><b class="medium">Nanako</b> likes to draw pictures of the nature such as flowers and trees. During the weekend,
      she would bring color pencils and paints outside and sit down on the ground to draw landscapes.
      Also, she likes to listen to music and her favorite singer is Shawn Mendes. If you have never listened to his
      songs, go to Youtube and search for "Shawn Mendes" before you start reading the comics:) </p>
